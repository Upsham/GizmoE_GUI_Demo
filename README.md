GUI Demo Code
===============

This repo contains GizmoE code with the demo GUI. It is intended to serve as a demonstartion of the system, and may deviate from the primarily Web-driven design of the original GizmoE system. Thus, it has been given it's own repo.

Essentially, this is a Netbeans project. Do update the file (gizmoe.capabilities.photo) if you want an actual photo to appear, the other images should be bundled as resources.
